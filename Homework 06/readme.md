# Customer Segmentation

## Dataset
     - Retail dataset is purchase of customer about 900K transaction
     
## Feature Engineering

     1. Reactivated	-> Number of customer who churn but come to visit again.
     
     2. Repeat	-> Number of customer who come to visit at least every 3 months.
     
     3. Recency -> Latest date when come to visit.
     
     4. Frequency -> Total visit each customers.
     
     5. Monetary -> Total spending each customers.
     
     6. Ticket_size -> Total spend per one time visit.
     
     7. Std_ticket_size -> Standard deviation of ticket size each customers.
     
     8. Length_of_stay -> The period of time that customers come to visit from the first day to the present.

## Interpretation

Cluster

     0:Low spend , Churn Customer

     1:Pretty low spend , Non-Active Customer

     2:High spend , Active Customer

     3:Pretty high spend , Active Customer

     4:Small to Medium Basket size , Non-Active Customer
